Based on the excellent [DiabloWeb](https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb) which, in turn, is based on the likewise excellent [Devilution](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution).

As the name implies, DiabloBlazor swaps out React used in DiabloWeb for Blazor, making it a double WebAssembly app: a WebAssembly (C#) OS installable, offline capable PWA hosting a WebAssembly (C++) game. It also leverages TypeScript instead of JavaScript (except for the JavaScript glue code generated by Emscripten).

You can try it out on [GitHub Pages](https://n-stefan.github.io/diabloblazor).

The development server can be found here: [DiabloBlazorServer](https://github.com/n-stefan/diabloblazorserver).

IDE: latest Visual Studio Community 2019 Preview with the Web Compiler extension installed.

When running locally, make sure that:
- Web Compiler has compiled site.scss
- LibMan has restored client-side libraries
